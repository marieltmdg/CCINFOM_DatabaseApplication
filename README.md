- This project was made using Apache Netbeans using an Apache Tomcat Server.
- The project cannot be directly imported into Apache Netbeans once downloaded and extracted from github.
- In order to properly be able to run it:
  1. Create a new project on Netbeans
  2. Copy the ff. folders/files into the new project's "Web Pages" folder:
     a. criminals
     b. crimes
     c. jails
     d. officers
     e. src
     f. index.html
     g. style.css
  4. Copy the criminalmanagement package into the new project's "Source Packages" folder
  5. Add the "mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar" file from the "lib" folder as a library in the new project
